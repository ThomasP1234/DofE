# Week 13
## Plan
- Work through one of the GCSE projects
## Work Done
- Created a 2 player dice rolling game
- The rules are:
  - The points rolled on each playerâ€™s dice are added to their score.
  - If the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score.
  - If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
  - If they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points rolled added to their score.
  - The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
  - The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
  - If both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).
  - Press enter to roll the 2 dice each
## What I learnt
