# Week 7 Work
## Plan
- Create a Conversion program from Celsius to Fahrenheit
## Work Done
- Created a program which:
  - Had a menu to choose from to select what you wanted to do (eg. Celsius to Fahrenheit)
  - Could accept float value so wasn't just resricted to whole numbers
  - Rounded the output to 1dp
  - Put the menu back up after the conversion and gave the user an option to quit or convert again
## What I learnt
- Functional decomposition (Allows the reuse of code and improves readablity of code)
- exit()
